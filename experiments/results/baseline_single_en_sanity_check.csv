1,tgqa_split_train,story42_Q1_0,"Given the following five events: (Lucas Prescott was married to Megan Peterson), (Lucas Prescott was born in Northampton, Massachusetts), (Megan Peterson was married to Lucas Prescott), (Megan Peterson died in Millwood Town, Austin), (Megan Peterson was born in Harmonyville, Florida). Which event is the first one in chronological order?","Lucas Prescott was born in Northampton, Massachusetts",,"<reasoning>
To determine which event is the first one in chronological order, we need to compare the start dates of each event. Events should be ordered from earliest to latest.
</reasoning>
<timeline>
- Lucas Prescott was born in Northampton, Massachusetts: 1908
- Megan Peterson was born in Harmonyville, Florida: 1921
- Megan Peterson was married to Lucas Prescott: 1946
- Lucas Prescott was married to Megan Peterson: 1946
- Lucas Prescott died in Oceanview: 1990
- Megan Peterson was married to Lucas Prescott: 1990
- Lucas Prescott was married to Megan Peterson: 1990
- Megan Peterson died in Millwood Town, Austin: 1997
</timeline>
<reflection>
The timeline shows that all events occur after 1908, so none of them can be the first one in chronological order. There seems to be a mistake in the provided information about the birth years of both individuals.
</reflection>

Since no correct chronological order exists due to the inconsistency in birth years, I cannot provide a meaningful answer based on the given data.",False
