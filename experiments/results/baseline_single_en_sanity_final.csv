Which event is the first one in chronological order?","Lucas Prescott was born in Northampton, Massachusetts",None,"<reasoning>
To determine which event is the first chronologically, we need to compare the start dates of each event. Events starting before others will come earlier in time.
</reasoning>
<timeline>
- (Lucas Prescott was born in Northampton, Massachusetts): 1908
- (Megan Peterson was born in Harmonyville, Florida): 1921
- (Megan Peterson was married to Lucas Prescott): 1946
- (Lucas Prescott was married to Megan Peterson): 1946
- (Lucas Prescott died in Oceanview): 1990
- (Megan Peterson was married to Lucas Prescott): 1990
- (Lucas Prescott was married to Megan Peterson): 1990
- (Megan Peterson died in Millwood Town, Austin): 1997
</timeline>
<reflection>
The timeline shows that all events occur after 1908, so none of them can be considered the earliest. However, since the question asks about the first event in chronological order, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate if there could be a typo or misinterpretation in the provided information.
